    # PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
    # ===================================================

    # Refer to the "Client Authentication" section in the PostgreSQL
    # documentation for a complete description of this file.  A short
    # synopsis follows.

    # This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
    # are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
    # databases they can access.  Records take one of these forms:
    #
    # local      DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
    # host       DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
    # hostssl    DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
    # hostnossl  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
    #
    # (The uppercase items must be replaced by actual values.)
    #
    # The first field is the connection type: "local" is a Unix-domain socket,
    # "host" is either a plain or SSL-encrypted TCP/IP socket, "hostssl" is an
    # SSL-encrypted TCP/IP socket, and "hostnossl" is a plain TCP/IP socket.
    #
    # DATABASE can be "all", "sameuser", "samerole", "replication", a
    # database name, or a comma-separated list thereof. The "all" keyword does
    # not match "replication". Access to replication must be enabled in a
    # separate record (see example below).
    #
    # USER can be "all", a user name, a group name prefixed with "+", or a comma-
    # separated list thereof.  In both the DATABASE and USER fields you can
    # also write a file name prefixed with "@" to include names from a separate
    # file.
    #
    # ADDRESS specifies the set of hosts the record matches.  It can be a host
    # name, or it is made up of an IP address and a CIDR mask that is an integer
    # (between 0 and 32 (IPv4) or 128 (IPv6) inclusive) that specifies the number
    # of significant bits in the mask.  A host name that starts with a dot (.)
    # means a suffix match. A separate file contains host name-to-address mappings.
    #
    # METHOD can be "trust", "reject", "md5", "password", "scram-sha-256",
    # "gss", "sspi", "ident", "peer", "pam", "ldap", "radius" or "cert".  Note
    # that "password" sends passwords in clear text; "md5" or "scram-sha-256"
    # should be used for password-based authentication (MD5 is preferred for
    # historical reasons).  "trust" does no authentication, and should not be
    # used.  "peer" authentication is only available on operating systems
    # providing the necessary PAM or ident support.
    #
    # OPTIONS are a set of options for the authentication in the format
    # NAME=VALUE.  The available options depend on the different authentication
    # methods -- refer to the "Client Authentication" section in the
    # documentation for a list of which options are available for which
    # authentication methods.
